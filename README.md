This project aims to compare 4 algorithms that solve the hitting set problem: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hitting-set-problem-is-np-complete/ 
by comparing their run time for various values of n (range of possible elements [1,n]), m (amount of subsets created), c (maximum subset size) and k (maximum hitting set size).
